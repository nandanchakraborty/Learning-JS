    <h1>Closure </h1>
    A local variable can only be used inside the function where it is defined. It is private and hidden from
     other functions and other scripting code.

Global and local variables with the same
 name are different variables. Modifying one, does not modify the other.

<h2>Note</h2>
Undeclared variables (created without a keyword var, let, const), are always global,
 even if they are created inside a function.
<h3>Example</h3>

The variable "a" is a global variable because it is undeclared:

<br>function myFunction()<br>{
 <br> a = 4;
<br>}

<h1>JavaScript Closures</h1>
<p>Counting with a local variable.</p>

<p id="demo">0</p>
<button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Count!</button>

<script>
function myCounter() {
  let counter = 0;
  return function() {
    counter++;
    return counter;
  };
}

const add = myCounter();

function myFunction(){
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = add();
}
</script>
What is really happening?

Normally, variables die after a function finishes.
But here, the inner function keeps a memory of counter.

That memory is called a closure.

So:

counter lives inside myCounter

The returned function remembers it

Every call updates the same variable
