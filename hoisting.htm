    <h1> Hoisting and Scope</h1>
  Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError.
This will result in a ReferenceError:
carName = "Volvo";
let carName;

Using a const variable before it is declared, is a syntax error, so the code will simply not run.

Example
This code will not run.

carName = "Volvo";
const carName;


console.log(z);
let z = 10;
Result
pgsql
Copy code
ReferenceError: Cannot access 'z' before initialization
Why?

let and const are hoisted

BUT they are placed in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)

You cannot use them before initialization

So for let and const:

Declaration is hoisted ✅

Access before initialization ❌
