    The Difference Between Arrays and Objects
In JavaScript, arrays use numbered indexes.  

In JavaScript, objects use named indexes.
Arrays are a special kind of objects, with numbered indexes.

The keyword const is a little misleading.

It does NOT define a constant array. It defines a constant reference to an array.

Because of this, we can still change the elements of a constant array.
